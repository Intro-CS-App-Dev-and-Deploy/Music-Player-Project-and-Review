CS30: this data structure into Objects Lists and Write / Rewrite Object Lists

Shuffle the Play List, but only play each song once
- randomly choose a number between zero & numberOfSongs
- "Have you played the song before?" (compare randomly chosen index with played indices)
- WHILE yes, pick new number
- IF no, save index into played array, play song

Easy Shuffle, able to play songs in any order, but songs might repeat before others are played
