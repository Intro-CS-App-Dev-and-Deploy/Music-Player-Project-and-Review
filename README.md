Static to Basic Objects, developing a Music Player either as a CS20-30 Review or CS10 Course Long Project

# Purpose
- Create Visual Data independant on the display
- Create a music player (using a library, Minim) dependant on the Songs being ```dropped``` into the folder

**Entire Music Program runs independent of display and music being played**

Note about file.txt:
- music player automatically finding music file and using file reading-writing to remember this file is an advanced application of CS30 and CS20
- extends the concept of program personalization based on file.txt and population of variables
