# Music Player
Static to Basic Objects, developing a Music Player either as a CS20-30 Review or CS10 Course Long Project

---

# To Do List
- Review Computer Science Planning and Grading to get a summary idea of curriculum and reference
- What other repositories should I incorporate and delete

---

# Purpose
- Create Visual Data independent on the display
- Create a music player (using a library, Minim) dependant on the Songs being ```dropped``` into the folder
- Understand how prototyping pieces can be incorporated into a larger program (rules for how code is read by compiler)
- Understand how pseudocode fits into static-dynamic-procedural-classes-abstractClasses-interfaces
- Understand how groups of lines are named and understood as sections in a larger program, when it can be ignored as functioning properly

**Entire Music Program runs independent of display and music being played**

Note about file.txt:
- music player automatically finding music file and using file reading-writing to remember this file is an advanced application of CS30 and CS20
- extends the concept of program personalization based on file.txt and population of variables
